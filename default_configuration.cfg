//# NETWORK SETTINGS
rate "1000000" //This command is like setting the speed limit for how much game data your computer can receive from the game server every second. The higher the number, the more data you can get quickly, which can make the game run smoother.
cl_predictweapons "1" //This command is about guessing what's going to happen with your weapons before the server tells your game. When it's on ("1"), your game tries to figure out things like when bullets are fired or when a gun is reloaded before the server confirms it, making the game feel more responsive.
cl_lagcompensation "1" //This command helps to fix issues when there's a delay (lag) between your actions in the game and what the server recognizes. With this turned on ("1"), the game tries to make up for the delay, so other players appear where they should be, despite the lag.
net_client_steamdatagram_enable_override "1" //This one likely involves using Steam's own network technology to connect to the game servers. When enabled ("1"), it might make your connection to the game server more stable and efficient, though the specific effects in Counter Strike 2 are not clearly detailed.

mm_dedicated_search_maxping "25" //This command limits the maximum ping for matchmaking servers. A lower value like "25" means you'll only connect to servers where your ping is below 25 milliseconds, which can reduce lag but might increase the time to find a match
mm_csgo_community_search_players_min "3" //This command couldn't be specifically found, but it likely sets the minimum number of players needed to start a community server game. Setting it to "3" would mean you need at least 3 players.
cl_resend "0.5" //This command controls how often your client resends a connection packet to the server if it doesn't get a response. Setting it to "0.5" means it resends every half a second.
cl_timeout "30" //This command sets the timeout duration (in seconds) before your client disconnects from the server when it stops receiving data. "30" means your game will wait 30 seconds before disconnecting.

cl_join_advertise "2" //This command controls who can see your game and join it. "2" might mean friends of friends can also join, not just direct friends.
cl_invites_only_friends "0" //This command sets whether only friends can send you game invites. "0" means anyone can send you invites, not just friends.
hud_scaling 0.90 //This command adjusts the size of the HUD on your screen. The value "0.90" means the HUD will be scaled to 90% of its original size. The scale must be between 0.5 and 0.95, with 0.95 being the largest size and 0.5 being the smallest. The default value is usually 0.85
cl_invites_only_mainmenu "0" //This command likely determines if you can receive game invites only when you are in the main menu. "0" means you can receive invites at any time, not just in the main menu.


//# HUD SETTINGS
